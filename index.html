🌸 Happy Birthday, My Love 🌸

To my sweetest Marzia,
Happy Birthday to the girl who makes my world brighter just by existing. From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed. You brought light where there was darkness, calm where there was chaos, and love where there was loneliness. I still can’t believe someone as beautiful, kind, and amazing as you chose me. I’m the luckiest person alive just to call you mine.

I know I’ve made mistakes. I haven’t always been perfect. But through it all, you stayed. You believed in me. You loved me. And that love means everything. Every little smile of yours, every word, every moment with you, it’s carved into my heart like a treasure I’ll hold forever.

On your special day, I just want one thing to make you feel how deeply loved you are. I want to celebrate all your birthdays with you. And all mine too. Side by side. Forever. I want to be there when you laugh, when you cry, when you dream, and when you wake up each day. Because life with you is the only life I want.

You are my home. My favorite hello. My hardest goodbye. My wish every time I see 11:11. And if I could give you the world, I would. But for now, I’m giving you all of me ,my heart, my soul, my future.

Happy Birthday, baby. May this year be as magical as your smile and as warm as your hugs. I love you, more than you’ll ever know.

Forever yours,
Farabi 💖
